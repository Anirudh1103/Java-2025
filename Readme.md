# Java 2025

This repository contains my day-wise learning progress for Java in 2025.  It includes code examples and notes covering various Java concepts, from basic to advanced.

## Content Overview

The repository is organized by topic, mirroring my learning journey.  Each day's work will be in a separate directory (e.g., `day01`, `day02`, etc.) within the main folder.

Here's a breakdown of the topics covered:

* **Basics of Java Programming:** Expressions, Variables, and Printing Output
* **Java Operators:** Assignment, Relational, Logical, and Short Circuit Operators
* **Java Conditionals:** `if` statement
* **Methods:** Parameters, Arguments, and Return Values
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Class, Object, State, and Behavior
* **Basics of OOP:** Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
* **Java Data Types:** Casting, Operators, and More
* **Java Built-in Classes:** `BigDecimal`, `String`, and Wrapper Classes
* **Conditionals:** `if-else`, Nested `if-else`, `switch`, and Ternary Operator
* **Loops:** `for`, `while`, `do-while`, `break`, and `continue`
* **Immutability:** Wrapper Classes, `String`, and `BigDecimal`
* **Java Dates:** `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, and `LocalDateTime`
* **Java Arrays and `ArrayList`:** String Arrays, Arrays of Objects, Primitive Data Types, `toString`, and Exceptions
* **Variable Arguments:** Introduction
* **Class Design:** Class, Object, State, Behavior, Deciding State, and Constructors
* **Object Composition and Inheritance:** Understanding
* **Abstract Classes and Interfaces:** Introduction to Polymorphism
* **Java Collections:**
    * `List` (ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector)
    * `Set` (HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet)
    * `Queue` (PriorityQueue)
    * `Map` (HashMap, HashTable, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap) - Comparison and Selection
* **Generics:** Why Generics? Restrictions with `extends`, Generic Methods, Wildcards (Upper Bound, Lower Bound)
* **Functional Programming:** Lambda Expressions, Streams, Stream Operations (Intermediate: `sort`, `distinct`, `filter`, `map`; Terminal: `max`, `min`, `collect`), Functional Interfaces (`Predicate`, `Consumer`, `Function`), Method References (static and instance)
* **Threads and Multithreading:** Need for Threads
* **Implementing Threads:** Extending `Thread` Class and Implementing `Runnable` Interface
* **Thread States and Communication:**
* **Executor Service:** Customizing Threads, Returning a `Future`, `invokeAll`, and `invokeAny`
* **Exception Handling:** Thought Process, `try`, `catch`, `finally`, Exception Hierarchy (Checked vs. Unchecked), Throwing Exceptions, Custom Exceptions (e.g., `CurrenciesDoNotMatchException`), Try-with-Resources (Java 7)
* **File I/O:** Listing Files/Folders (listFiles, walk, find), Reading and Writing Files
